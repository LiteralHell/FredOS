# FredOS
A very basic 16-bit operating system based off the OS creation tutorial on the MikeOS website.
You can find that guide here: http://mikeos.sourceforge.net/write-your-own-os.html

FredOS's aim is to be as free from nasties as possible. We won't try and track you, trick you, or profit off of you in any way at all.

This project is in a very early phase, so expect bugs and lack of functionality for now.
